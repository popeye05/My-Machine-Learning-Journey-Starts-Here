Hi, 
So this is a obviously a very basic Project, but this is actually the first project ive done, 
so i know its not that great, but still, it really took me out of the depression that i had after all learning maths rigorously for almost 2 months continiuosly,
I saw the MOVIE RECOMMENDATION PROJECT by CAMPUSX and thought lets make it for games and thats it i guess, ive uploaded the codes, 
ive truncated the dataset of stream into 10000 entries (which was 40K, yeah my computer crashed at first:(then i fixed it thou:) )

**similarity.pkl i.e the similarity pickled dataframe cant be uploaded in github because its(10000,10000) so 759.8 MB, but ive uploaded the jupyter notebook so you can get the similarity.pkl by yourself woohoo!

enjoy!!
