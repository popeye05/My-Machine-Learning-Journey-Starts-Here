Hi, 
So this is a obviously a very basic Project, but this is actually the first project ive done, 
so i know its not that great, but still, it really took me out of the depression that i had after all learning maths rigorously for almost 2 months continiuosly,
I saw the MOVIE RECOMMENDATION PROJECT by CAMPUSX and thought lets make it for games and thats it i guess, ive uploaded the codes, 
ive truncated the dataset of stream into 10000 entries (which was 40K, yeah my computer crashed at first:(then i fixed it thou:) )

enjoy!!
